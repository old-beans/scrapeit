 contact us   applications   techniques   products   media gallery   contact us   electron microscopy (em) has a wide variety of applications in forensic investigation. numerous crime-scene micro-traces, including glass and paint fragments, tool marks, drugs, explosives and gunshot residue (gsr) can be visually and chemically analyzed with   scanning electron microscopy (sem)   . the conclusions based on this analysis are critical as they can establish the nature of the crime, as well as who was involved.   criminal investigators are often faced with the daunting task of analyzing crime scenes where firearms were used. gunshot residue (gsr) analysis is a standard technique for determining whether a given individual or firearm was involved in the incident in question. established gsr analysis begins with sem surveying of suspected gsr particles, which are typically 0.5 to 10 micrometers in size. if a matching particle is found, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (eds) is used within the sem to identify the chemical composition of that particle. the most common search criteria are the presence of lead (pb), barium (ba), and antimony (sb). once a sample is confirmed to be the result of a gunshot, its characteristics can be used as supporting evidence in the investigation.   traditionally this type of analysis was performed manually, and the forensic scientist would dedicate significant time to the characterization and comparison of evidence. the   thermo scientific phenom perception gsr desktop sem   images   gunshot residue particle analyzed
